## Dart-Code E2E Tests

Some end-to-end tests for Dart-Code using Playwright.

Most extension tests live in the Dart-Code/Dart-Code repository and run using the VS Code APIs. This repository is for things that are difficult or impossible to test through the VS Code APIs and require driving the UI (for example interaction with embedded Flutter apps like the DevTools property editor).
